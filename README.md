This is a script designed for [Trading View](https://www.tradingview.com) and is supposed to be my take on the Market Cipher B indicator.

## Insperation
As much as I'd love to have the Market Cipher package. I can't afford it.
I'm just getting into trading, and as I have the skill-set to create my own version - that is what I've done.
One of the things I love about this project, is that every feature I add, and every variable I create helps me to understand the data, and how it is made up.

## Features
### Customise it!
The script is very customisable. That however, means that the settings box for this indicator is quite long.

### Dots
There are 2 types of "dots"
The first type of dots are the same as you get in the normal Market Cipher B, and let you know when conditions aregood for a trade.
I have added to this my increasing the size of the dots if at the same time, the Bollinger Bars cross the chart candles (indicating a possible trend-reversal)

## Ideas?
If you have any ideas for the indicator, then please don't hesitate to open an issue and I'll get back to you.
